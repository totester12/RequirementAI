# Requirement AI

A quick pass at a PRD Builder using
- React / Vite
- Tailwind
- OpenAI API

Built as a learning project around
- API Access
- Streaming Responses
- State management between parent/child
- Tab Menu
- Prompting

Not great things
- State at top level changing on streaming is probably causing a lot of renders
- Key in .env but not building out auth / backend for this.
- No error catching
- Lots more

If theres a key in the old commits its not active.
